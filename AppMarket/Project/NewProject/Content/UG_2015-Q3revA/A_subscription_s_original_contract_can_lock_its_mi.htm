        <p><span class="_Override">For example, consider a subscription contract that stipulates 50GB as the number of units. This originating contract lasts 6 months, and is then renewed automatically. Due to the automatic renewal, a follow-on contract is created, but the customer has updated the contract’s stipulations to specify 100GB as the units. In this case, when this marketplace behavior is turned On, the customer might reduce the number of units under 100GB but is prevented from lowering them under 50GB.</span>
