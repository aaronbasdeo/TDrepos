        <p>Where this guide cites an exact navigation path to see or use a given feature, the navigation path on your own marketplace might differ. All platform UI labels are customizable, and the applied skin determines which and how many navigational levels your marketplace exposes. Furthermore, your assigned user roles are a framework for authorization that limit<span class="_Override"> w</span>hat you can see and do.</p>
        <p>Conceptually, we spread features and feature sets from the AppDirect platform across a series of concentric tiers (plans), where larger tiers <span class="_Override">include the</span> features from <span class="_Override">s</span>maller tiers that they encircle. <span class="_Override">Core</span> features, such as billing and distribution, are so essential, so fundamental, that the overall platform cannot exist without them. Such features are integral to what we call our volume plans. Volume plans exclude certain feature sets naturally. For example, a lower-plan marketplace will not include any of the features that add value to a higher plans. To learn about our service tiers, see <a>http://info.appdirect.com/plans</a>.</p>
        <p>Certain other features can also be disabled per marketplace, upon request. Also, certain features might be present on a marketplace but moved to a different navigation path, upon&#160;request. </p>
        <p>The visibility of certain UI elements is contingent upon <span class="_Override">your </span>prior selections in the UI, and the user roles that are assigned to you constrain which UI elements you can see.</p>
