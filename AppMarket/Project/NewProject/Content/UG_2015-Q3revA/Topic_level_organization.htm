        <p>Parallel topic types tend to be at least somewhat parallel in their organization and, often, are organized in exactly the same way every time. For example, two conceptual topics that both describe workflows are liable to match one another’s organization up to a point, as would two reference topics that cite and explain error messages. However, the organization of a workflow topic probably has very little at all in common structurally with a reference topic that cites and explains error messages. </p>
        <p>Most procedures follow most or all of this pattern: <i style="font-family: 'Myriad Pro';font-style: italic;">Summary</i>, <i style="font-family: 'Myriad Pro';font-style: italic;">Before You Begin</i>, <i style="font-family: 'Myriad Pro';font-style: italic;">Procedure</i>, <i style="font-family: 'Myriad Pro';font-style: italic;">What to Do Next</i>, and <i style="font-family: 'Myriad Pro';font-style: italic;">Related Topics</i>. However, some procedural topics might deviate minimally from this&#160;sketch.</p>
