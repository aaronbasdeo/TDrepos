        <p>As the marketplace provider, your company has many strategic reasons to <span class="_Override">manage</span> <span class="_Override">its </span>product inventory with great care. </p>
        <p>The first phase of this process is inventory selection. The products in your catalog should accomplish several interconnected goals.</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Regular';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;font-size: 9pt;letter-spacing: 0em;color: #000000;text-decoration: none;">Drive casual traffic.</p>

        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Regular';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;font-size: 9pt;letter-spacing: 0em;color: #000000;text-decoration: none;">Drive long-term profitability for your company and its marketplace partners — including vendors and resellers — by generating revenue that meets or exceeds your forecasts.</p>
        <p>After you choose inventory for your catalog, we recommend that your company look at making products easy to find, by organizing and categorizing them in ways that are clear to your target customers.</p>
        <p><span class="_Override">You might also find it worthwhile to shape product profile page content at a high level. To do this, you can show or hide certain types of marketing content and user-generated content on them universally or conditionally, and you can specify in some cases which values are available for product vendors to cite.</span>
        </p>
        <p>The next phase is promotional. A well designed discount can drive sales generally and a well designed bundle can increase your average deal size. </p>
