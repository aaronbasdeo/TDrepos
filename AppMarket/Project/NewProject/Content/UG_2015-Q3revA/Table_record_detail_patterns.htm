        <p>An AppDirect-powered marketplace can represent various kinds of records very broadly, as it does for example when it shows authorized users the complete, historical set of all orders that it has ever received. Your marketplace can also tighten a given set’s focus to any narrowed subset. A good example of such narrowing might limit the scope to cover only the orders from one company in particular —&#160;hiding every irrelevant record. </p>
        <p>Even more pointedly, a marketplace can expose the granular details from one record in isolation. The effect amounts broadly — but not exactly — to an executive summary along these lines: </p>
        <p style="margin-top: 3pt;margin-bottom: 8pt;font-family: 'Fantasque Sans Mono';font-weight: normal;font-style: normal;font-size: 7pt;letter-spacing: 0em;color: #000000;line-height: 8pt;text-decoration: none;"><span class="S_Sample">User X from Company Y ordered a year-long subscription to Product Z on August&#160;1 of last year, payable in installments on a monthly billing cycle, to which she applied a 10&#160;percent discount and for which her current payment is now 30&#160;days past&#160;due&#160;—&#160;relative to the product’s configured 10-day grace period for late payments.<br /></span>
        </p>
        <p>That<span class="_Override"> i</span>s not literally how we represent information in the details view for one order. It is illustrative, however, of the types of granular detail that such a record can expose in its details view. Records of any given type expose supporting details that are pertinent to its type most&#160;especially. </p>
        <p>And of course, orders are not the only kind of record that your marketplace stores. It keeps records about products, product editions, users, companies, orders, payments, subscription contracts, and dozens of other things that help to make your marketplace useful and help to keep your marketplace trustworthy. Most stored records include the kinds of supporting details that lend depth and insight to your understanding of them.</p>
        <p>Access to any given record’s detail view is restricted to the same users who can load any list that cites the record. When your account has the necessary authority to list all records in a set, or all records in a subset, you are also authorized to view details about each<span class="_Override"> r</span>ecord that the list cites.</p>
        <p>Depending on your user role assignments, you might have access to a wide range of record types and sets. However, most users have access to a limited number of records, drawn from a limited pool of record types. Any details that you might have access to view are a part of <span class="_Override">this</span> set.</p>
