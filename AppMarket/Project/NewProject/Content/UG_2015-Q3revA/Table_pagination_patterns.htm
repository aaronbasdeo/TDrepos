        <p>The first and most vital thing to understand about a UI table is that it could contain more records than the maximum number of rows it exposes to you — where each row represents only one&#160;record. In such cases, the table flows its additional rows automatically across as many virtual pages as it must straddle, given the constraint that its number of rows imposes upon it.</p>
        <p>This means, a UI table might <i>hide</i> many more records from you than it <i>shows</i> — until you understand how to navigate easily to its hidden records.</p>
        <p>Suppose for example that a given table exposes only 20 rows on screen at one time even though it contains 100 records. Pagination controls under the table help you to:</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1">Discover that those hidden records are available and navigable.</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1">Navigate <i>through</i> any of its hidden records <i>to</i> any of its hidden records.<br /></p>
        <p>Whenever pagination controls are visibly present under a UI table, you know immediately that the table contains more records than it has rows. <span class="_Override">A</span>fter all, when the rendered rows in a table are perfectly sufficient to represent its every record, there is no need for it to straddle multiple pages.<span class="_Override"></span></p>

        <p MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.gigantic_image_to_hide">The illustrative screenshot here, for example, indicates that the table’s visible rows on screen constitute — at most — just one-fifth of its navigable records. </p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.gigantic_image_to_hide">You can tell from the highlighted page number “1” in these pagination controls that only the first subset of table rows is visible on screen currently.</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1" MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.gigantic_image_to_hide">You can click any page number to replace the table’s currently rendered subset of rows with your preferred subset. </p>
