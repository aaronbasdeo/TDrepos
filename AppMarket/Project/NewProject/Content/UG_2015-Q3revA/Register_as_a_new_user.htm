For example, perhaps your marketplace provider also supplies your telephone or Internet connection. In such a case, your provider might support the convenience of charging XaaS purchases to your established account. Or, its standard policy might be to unify all of your transactions into one account.</p>

                        <p class="CB_CellBody">Some providers solicit and collect a national ID from you during registration. This ID is <b>not</b> tied to you as an individual person, but rather to your associated company. For example, companies that do business in Australia all have a national ID number called either an <i>ABN</i> or an <i>ACN</i>. Asking you for this ID constitutes a reasonable effort (for XaaS licensing purposes) to confirm that you are based in the correct locale. </p>
                        <p class="CB_CellBody">We cross-check this value against a governmental registry to ensure that it is valid for your associated company. When it is not valid, you must correct it and try again, or your attempt to register a new user account fails. </p>
