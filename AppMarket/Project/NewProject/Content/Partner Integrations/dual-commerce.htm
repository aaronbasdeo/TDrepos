        <h1>Dual Commerce Management</h1>
        <p>Microsoft has a long running reseller program called Syndication which is end of life in June 2017. The newest version of the Microsoft reseller program is called CSP. It has a different and richer set of APIs and more SKUs.</p>
        <p>Microsoft resellers currently using the Syndication program must move to the new CSP program. This move to CSP is a multi-step process. Dual Commerce Management is one of the steps.</p>
        <p>When Dual Commerce is enabled on a reseller marketplace a new end user is directed to the CSP program and can purchase Microsoft products that are available under CSP only. Existing Syndication end users continue to use the Syndication program and can only purchase Microsoft products available under the Syndication program. They cannot buy CSP only products.</p>
        <p>The implementation of Dual Commerce capabilities on a marketplace does not have any retroactive effect on existing contracts, orders, or SKUs. However, it affects new contracts, new orders, and new SKUs.</p>
        <p>Once Dual Commerce has been configured on a marketplace, new Microsoft products available only through the CSP program can be sold on the marketplace.</p>
        <div class="note">
            <p><b>Notes:</b> Microsoft product profiles on the marketplace that use Syndication SKUs should not be changed.</p>
            <p>	The Dual Commerce feature can only be enabled. It should not be disabled.</p>
            <p>	The Syndication and CSP connectors must be correctly configured and need to be set up with the correct reseller credentials.</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Procedure to enable Dual Commerce on a marketplace</h4>
        <p>Before enabling Dual Service on their marketplace a reseller must be approved for the Microsoft CSP program.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Once approval is granted the syndication reseller partner enables CSP on their marketplace.</li>
            <li>Go to<strong> Manage &gt; Channel &gt; Settings</strong> and click<strong>Microsoft</strong>.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions to configure a connection between the AppDirect Marketplace and your CSP reseller account.</li>
        </ol>
