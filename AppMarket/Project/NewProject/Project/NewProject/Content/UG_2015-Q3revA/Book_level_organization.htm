        <p>This guide serves multiple audiences and, at the highest level, material in this guide is grouped and sorted by&#160;audience.</p>
        <p>The sub-guides (“books”) that comprise this guide each address a fairly distinct audience — one with its own clear agenda and its own mix of knowledge, access, and authority. Each such “book” aims to support its corresponding audience in completing the work at hand. Within a book, each chapter is almost like a miniature guide, which focuses on one relatively narrow agenda or feature set — as specified in the chapter title. </p>
        <p>There is not necessarily any rigid correspondence between the flow of topics in a chapter and the visual arrangement of interface elements in a software UI. Instead, user goals and workflows are the framework upon which we develop topics and chapters.</p>
