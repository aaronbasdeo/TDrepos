        <p>AppDirect-powered marketplaces support the option, via a UI control that adjusts <b>httpd.conf</b> on the backend, to password-protect everything on their host server, including even its standard login form for individual users. </p>
        <p>This feature is used most commonly when a marketplace is not yet open for business, while it undergoes basic testing. It prevents user dissatisfaction with a site that is reachable but not actually ready for use. However, your relationship with a given marketplace&#160;—&#160;maybe as one of its administrators or developers&#160;—&#160;might require your engagement with it long before ordinary consumers learn that the server even&#160;exists.</p>
        <p>In such cases (or whenever else this option is used), you must know the sitewide credentials that compel the server to send page data to your browser. These credentials almost certainly differ from your personal username and your personal password, which you must then enter as usual.</p>
        <p>Most marketplaces are not secured in this way.</p>
        <p class="BL_BlockLabel">Procedure</p>
        <p class="SF_StepFirst">Go to <i style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Black';color: #0000ff;">https://</i><span class="S_Sample">{marketplace}</span>, where <span class="S_Sample">{marketplace}</span> is the fully qualified and DNS resolvable server name for your marketplace instance.</p>
        <p>Your browser does not receive any data to render the usual user interface for your marketplace. Instead, a modal dialog box opens, which prompts you to enter sitewide credentials.</p>
        <p class="SN_StepNext">Enter the sitewide username and the sitewide password. Then, press <b>Enter</b>.</p>
        <p>When you submit valid sitewide credentials, the modal dialog box closes and the server returns enough information that your browser can render the marketplace user interface — including the standard login form for individual users. </p>
        <p class="SN_StepNext">Stop. You have completed this procedure.</p>
