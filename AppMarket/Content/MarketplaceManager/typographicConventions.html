        <p>The procedures in this document use the following typographic path convention to help you navigate to the specific page where you make the settings:</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">Go to <strong>Manage &gt; Marketplace &gt; Settings &gt;&#160;</strong>Settings<strong>&#160;|&#160;General Settings</strong>.&#160;</p>
        <p>All words that are&#160;<strong>bold</strong>, are links, buttons, or icons you must click to navigate to the target page for the given procedure. The words in the path that are&#160;<em>not&#160;</em>bold (Settings in the previous example) appear in the UI but you do <em>not </em>click them. They are typically headings for the links grouped below them.</p>
        <p>The following image shows the UI locations for the elements in the sample path. Note that step 2 (Marketplace) is not visible until you click 1 (Manage).</p>
