        <h1>Purchase products on behalf of a user</h1>
        <p>In most cases, individual end users do not purchase their own products. Instead, products are purchased on their behalf by individuals with one of the following roles: Sales Support, Reseller, or Marketplace Manager.&#160;</p>
        <p>The following procedure explains how Marketplace Managers can purchase products on behalf of users.</p>
        <p class="ProcedureIntro">To purchase products on behalf of a user</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Go to <strong>Manage</strong>&#160;&gt; <strong>Marketplace</strong>&gt; <strong>Dashboard</strong> &gt; Home | <strong>Users</strong>. The Users page opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click the&#160;user for whom you want to purchase a product. The user's details page opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Make Purchase</strong>.&#160;The Choose a Product to Purchase dialog box appears.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> In the left pane, click the application&#160;you want to purchase on behalf of the user. It appears on the right side.&#160;</p>

                </p>
                <p>(placeholder for image)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> (Optional) If you have already discussed the purchase with the user and received his or her approval, click <strong>Additional Options</strong> to expand&#160;the dialog box, and select the checkbox under the Already Received Approval&#160;heading.&#160;</p>
                <p>When you indicate that a purchase has been pre-approved by the user, you can complete the purchase without the need for approval by the user, and the order completion and confirmation process are slightly different. Those differences are outlined in steps 10 and&#160;11, below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Start Purchase</strong>. A purchase confirmation page opens, on which you can select options or add-ons.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p> (Optional) Choose purchase options and add-ons. Depending on the product, options can include changing the number of users, modifying the price, changing from a free trial to a purchased version of the product (or the reverse), and applying a discount code.</p>

                </p>
                <div class="note">If you are not ready to place the order, you can click <strong>Save a Quote</strong> in the top-left corner and complete the order later.

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Click <strong>Continue</strong>. The Complete Billing Details page opens.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Select one of the following&#160;payment methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>PayPal</strong>—You must have the user's credentials to complete the purchase.</li>
                    <li><strong>Credit card</strong>—If the user has not yet entered credit card information for his or her account, ensure that you have all of the details required to complete the transaction&#160;(see the fields in the following image).</li>
                    <li><strong>Manual payment</strong>—The payment takes place outside of the AppDirect platform. As the Channel Administrator, it is your responsibility to coordinate payment directly with the user.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When you select a payment method, corresponding billing information fields become visible, which you must fill out in order to proceed with the purchase.</p>
                <p>The following example demonstrates a payment with a credit card when a user is making a purchase with this payment method for the first time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>If the user has previously purchased a product, the Complete Billing Details page resembles the following example, with the previously used payment method automatically selected. If there is no change in billing details, it is not necessary to re-enter all of the information outlined above. However, if the user wants to use a different credit card than one previously used, he or she must update the credit card information from within his or her own account.</p>

            </li>
        </ol>
        <ul>

In those cases, the initial user, for whom the product was purchased, is able to use the service immediately, but you must assign the application to the additional users before they can access it.
