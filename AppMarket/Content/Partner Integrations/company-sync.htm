        <p>The Company synchronization (Company Sync) feature makes onboarding new companies into the AppDirect Marketplace easier. It allows Channel Administrators to onboard new companies by synchronizing company data and the primary contact for the Microsoft account directly from Microsoft to the AppDirect Marketplace. Company sync can take place automatically or with a single click.</p>
        <p>This feature is relevant in the context of company migration from independent Microsoft reseller programs to the AppDirect Marketplace. For more information see <MadCap:xref href="Advisor, Open and CSP company migration using Microsoft multi-channel capabilities.htm">Advisor, Open and CSP company migration using Microsoft multi-channel capabilities</MadCap:xref>.</p>
        <h3 class="spy_this" id="procedure"><span style="font-family: AauxNext-Bold-Web, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 1em;">Procedure</span>
        </h3>
        <p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go to <strong>Manage &gt; Channel &gt; Settings &gt;</strong> Data Sync <strong>| Sync Settings</strong>.</p>
        <p>
            <img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3128" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3128/original/company-sync-settings.png" />
        </p>
        <p>There are 2 Company Sync settings:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create companies automatically</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When enabled the AppDirect Marketplace will attempt to create companies when it detects them.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If disabled the Channel Administrator will need to review which companies are to be  manually created. To do this go to <strong>Manage &gt; Channel &gt; Marketplace &gt;</strong> Home | <strong>Pending Companies</strong>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Invite admins when companies are created</strong>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">When enabled the AppDirect Marketplace will automatically invite the administrator when the company is created. This applies to companies that are created automatically or manually.</p>
        <p style="margin-left: 40px;">If disabled the AppDirect Marketplace will not automatically invite the administrator when the company is created. In this case the Channel Administrator invites them at a later date.</p>
        <p>When <em>Create companies automatically</em> is disabled and <em>Invite admins when company created</em> is enabled, companies are created manually and the administrator receives an invite at the moment of creation.</p>
        <p>Select your settings and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2. </strong>When companies are synced and not automatically invited, the Company sync setting <em>Invite admins when company created</em> is disabled, companies are held in a Pending Companies table and must be created in the AppDirect Marketplace. To do this go to <strong>Manage &gt; Channel &gt; Marketplace &gt;</strong> Home | <strong>Pending Companies</strong>. The Pending Companies page is displayed. The left navigation pane displays the number of pending companies.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3.</strong> Select the <strong>{companyName}</strong> checkbox and click <strong>Create Selected</strong> to manually sync a company into the AppDirect Marketplace. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>Once a company is created it is removed from the Pending Companies table. It is then available in <strong>Manage &gt; Channel &gt; Marketplace &gt;</strong> Home | <strong>Companies</strong>. You can start selling to the company once you have set up a valid payment method.</p>

        <h3 class="spy_this" id="known-limitations">Known Limitations</h3>
        <p>There is currently a limitation of Company Sync that if a customer's Tenant does not have a Billing Profile with a valid email address the creation will fail.
