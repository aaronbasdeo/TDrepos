<p>An add-on can be canceled from an order without canceling the product or other add-ons. However, when an order includes a product and an add-on, the add-on must be canceled before the product can be canceled.</p>

<p>User management (assignment and unassignment of users) applies to a product and its add-ons as a whole. An add-on cannot be assigned to or unassigned from a user independently of the product.</p>

<p>An add-on cannot be purchased on its own. It is only after adding an associated product to an order that a purchaser sees that an add-on is available. Add-ons are always optional.</p>

<p>Every add-on is specific to a product, and every web application or stacked web application product can have one or more add-ons. No other product types support&#160;add-ons.</p>

<p><br />
Add-on offerings&#160;are additional items or services that customers can purchase when they buy a product. For example, an add-on might include a preset amount of additional storage space or time-limited access to a professional service.</p><body /></html>
