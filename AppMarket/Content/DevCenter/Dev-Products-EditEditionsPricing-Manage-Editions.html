<p>When you create a new product, the manner in which you configure&#160;it, including the name, features and benefits, pricing, payment plans, and what's included, is saved as an Edition—that is, the first version of the product. From there, you can:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create new editions (or versions) of the product, with different pricing and other elements.&#160;Each edition is essentially a&#160;pricing plan&#160;variant&#160;of the product that customers can purchase.</li>
	<li>Manage any of the editions you previously created.</li>
</ul>

<p>This page provides a description of how to manage an existing edition. To learn more about creating a new edition, see&#160;<a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" target="“_blank”">Add editions</a>.</p>

<h4><span style="font-family: AauxNext-Bold-Web, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 1em;">Procedure</span></h4>

<p>Complete the following procedure to manage an existing edition.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1.&#160;</strong>Click <strong>Manage </strong>&gt;<strong> Billing and Distribution&#160;</strong>&gt;<strong> Products </strong>&gt; {Product name}&#160;|&#160;<strong>Edit</strong>&#160;&gt; Editions and Pricing |&#160;<strong>Editions. </strong>The area&#160;expands to display a list of all existing editions.&#160;</p>

<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Click the name of the edition you want to manage. The Manage Editions page opens for the selected edition.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3372" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3372/original/1-20screen-20shot-202017-03-03-20at-2010-51-03-20am.png" style="height: 487px;width: 600px;" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong>&#160;Review and edit the edition details as needed using the following descriptions.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong>—The&#160;name of this specific edition. The recommended naming&#160;convention is to differentiate each edition from other editions by size,&#160;expense,&#160;audience or other criteria relevant to your business. For example, you could use names such as:</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Free edition, Standard edition, Pro edition</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Bronze, Silver, Gold</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Home edition, Office edition</li>
	<li><strong>Edition code</strong>—The edition code used to link to the developer's editions within their own system. It can be any string of characters. If not applicable, enter any value (you cannot leave this field blank).</li>
	<li><strong>Target audience</strong>—The label that appears on the pricing and editions page. It is useful in helping&#160;users identify which edition&#160;to buy. For example: consumer, small business, enterprise.</li>
	<li><strong>Position</strong>&#160;(edition ranking)—The order in which this edition is displayed if you have more than one edition. For example, Gold, Silver, Bronze. Enter 1 for the highest ranking edition, 2 for the second-ranked edition, and so on.</li>
	<li>This&#160;field&#160;also determines which edition is considered an upgrade or downgrade. The higher the number, the higher the rank, so that going from edition 4 to 3, for example, is considered an upgrade.</li>
	<li><strong>Show as primary pricing plan</strong>—Makes this edition the primary pricing plan, and selects this edition by default when the user clicks the Buy Now button on the product profile.&#160;</li>
	<li><strong>Purchase options</strong>—Four purchase options are available.&#160;Click any that apply for the edition you are creating. Following is a description of each option.&#160;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>This edition is selected when a customer chooses a one-click free trial</strong>—Determines which of the editions is selected for one-click free trials, when there are multiple editions that are free or have free trials.&#160;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>This edition can only be bought as part of a bundle</strong>—Creates an edition of the product that can be used as part of a bundle but is not visible when buying the product separately. It does not appear on the editions and pricing page for any user.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>This edition is hidden from marketplace customers</strong>—Restricts visibility once the edition is published. Only marketplace employees, marketplace managers, sales support representatives, and resellers can see it. Although it is hidden from marketplace customers, it can be purchased on behalf of customers. Once purchased on behalf of a customer, the customer can manage the edition.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Enable lead generation</strong>—If this option is clicked, interested customers can&#160;submit their contact information instead of purchasing the product outright, and a lead is created.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4.</strong><![CDATA[ ]]> <![CDATA[ ]]><strong>Edit</strong> the Payment plans fields and options. Notice how, in the manage edition mode,&#160;additional fields have been added for all revenue models, with the exception of the Free model. Review and complete the fields to ensure this edition's description, price, and other elements are as you want them.</p>

<p>Please note that the fields that appear on the page vary based on the revenue model that you selected when you created the edition. If you change the revenue model, some of the&#160;fields may also change.</p>

<p>For detailed&#160;information&#160;about each of the revenue models available, and how to configure them, please see <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/payment-plans-and-revenue-models-explained" target="“_blank”">Payment plans and revenue models explained</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5. Review</strong><strong>&#160;</strong>the included items and the features and benefits descriptions and, if required, make modifications. See <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" target="“_blank”">Add editions</a> for information and procedures regarding both sections.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong>&#160;After you complete&#160;your edits, click&#160;one of the following links:&#160;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Save and preview—</strong>Saves your edits and displays the Editions &amp; Pricing tab of the product's profile This allows you to view how your product appears to users. If required, you can perform additional edits by clicking <strong>Edit Profile</strong>. Then <strong>move your mouse</strong> down into the product name area and <strong>click</strong> the pencil. This opens the Manage Your Product page, where you can make additional changes.</li>
	<li><strong>Save plan—</strong>&#160;Immediately saves your edits, and returns you to the Product Dashboard.</li>
	<li><strong>Cancel</strong>—Cancels your changes</li>
	<li><strong>Delete pricing plan</strong>—Deletes this edition&#160;</li>
</ul>
