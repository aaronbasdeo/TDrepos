<p>After you create&#160;your first edition of a product, you may want to create more. For example, if you want the product to be available on a free trial basis, and also as a paid service with no trial period, you need two editions of the product.</p>

<p>This page describes the steps required to add a new edition of a product.</p>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Click&#160;<strong>Add New Edition</strong>. The Add Addition page opens.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3.&#160;</strong>Enter information in the Edit information fields at the top of the page.</p>

<div class="tips_banner">Most fields on the Add Edition page have&#160;a help icon&#160;that provides a brief description of the field or option. The following images show the page in sections. Additional&#160;information&#160;is included after each image&#160;to help you create your edition.</div>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3455" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3455/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-09-20at-2012-28-00-20pm.png" style="height: 427px;width: 600px;" /></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a.&#160;Name</strong>—The name for this specific edition. Select a name that differentiates this edition from others, such as size,&#160;expense,&#160;audience or other criteria relevant to your business. For example, you could use names such as:&#160;</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Free, Standard, Pro&#160;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Bronze, Silver, Gold</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">Home, Office</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Edition code</strong>—Used to link to the developer's editions within their own system. It can be any string of characters. If not applicable to your product, enter any value.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Target audience</strong>—Appears on the pricing and editions page for your product. It is useful in helping&#160;users identify which edition to buy. For example: consumer, small business, enterprise.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>d. Position</strong>—Ranks your editions in sequence&#160;if you have more than one edition of the product. &#160;For example, Gold, Silver, Bronze. Enter 1 for the highest ranking edition, 2 for the second-ranked edition, and so on.</p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">This&#160;field also determines which edition is considered an upgrade or downgrade. The higher the number, the higher the rank, so for example, going from edition 4 to 3 is considered an upgrade.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;">If you enter a checkmark in&#160;the checkbox below the Position field, this&#160;edition is highlighted as a best seller and is selected by default when the user clicks the Buy Now button on the product profile.​</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>e. Show as primary pricing plan</strong>—Makes this edition the primary pricing plan, and selects this edition by default when the user clicks the Buy Now button on the product profile.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>f. Purchase options</strong>—Four purchase options are available.&#160;Click any that apply for the edition you are creating.&#160;Following is a description of each option.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>g. This edition is selected when a customer chooses a one-click free trial</strong>—Determines which of the editions is selected for one-click free trials, when there are multiple editions that are free or have free trials.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>h. This edition can only be bought as part of a bundle</strong>—Creates an edition of the product that can be used as part of a bundle but is not visible when buying the product separately. It does not appear on the editions and pricing page for any user.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>i. This edition is hidden from marketplace customers</strong>—Restricts visibility after the edition is published. Only marketplace employees, marketplace managers, sales support representatives, and resellers can see it. Although it is hidden from marketplace customers, it can be purchased on behalf of customers. After it is purchased on behalf of a customer, the customer can manage the edition.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Enable lead generation</strong>—When clicked, interested customers can&#160;submit their contact information instead of purchasing the product outright, and a lead is generated.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Complete the Payment Plans area.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Four revenue models are available: free, one time, recurring and tiered.</li>
	<li>The appearance of the Payment Plan page varies based on the revenue model you choose. When you select a revenue model for your edition,&#160;the relevant fields and options for that model automatically appear&#160;for you to complete. &#160;</li>
	<li>For information and procedures relating to each of the four revenue plans available, please see <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/payment-plans-and-revenue-models-explained" target="“_blank”">Payment plans and revenue models explained</a>.</li>
