<p>Marketplace Managers can configure&#160;media sources and featured customers that Developers can later include in their product profiles when they are defining a product. These marketing tools are designed to build customer confidence in a product they encounter on your marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Featured customers</strong>—Recognizable companies that are&#160;customers of the Developer's product or service.</p>

<p><strong>Media sources</strong>—References to product reviews or other mentions of the Developer's company or product in a blog post, newpaper or magazine article, television program, and so on.&#160;</p>

<div class="note_banner">Note: As a Developer, you&#160;can only add customer and media references to a product after the Marketplace Manager has configured specific customers and media. Once configured,&#160;those resources are available for Developers.</div>
