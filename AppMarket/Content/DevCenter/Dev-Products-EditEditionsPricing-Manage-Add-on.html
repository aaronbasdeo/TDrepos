<p>After you have created one or more add-ons, you can manage them by changing fields and options within the add-on product, or by cancelling the add-on. The procedure described on this page assumes you have created at least one add-on, and that you want to modify one or more elements that were previously-configured or cancel the add-on.</p>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p>Step 1. Navigate to&#160;<strong>Developer</strong>&#160;&gt; Dashboard |&#160;<strong>Products</strong>&#160;|&#160;{Product}&#160;&gt;&#160;<strong>Edit</strong>. This opens the product configuration page. On the left side of the page, you can see the number of add-ons currently available for this product. There are currently two add-on offerings&#160;in this example.</p>

<p>Step 2. Click&#160;<strong>Add-on-Offerings&#160;</strong>to show the add-ons currently available. In the following example they are: Add user and Free domain name.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3400" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3400/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-06-20at-2012-21-17-20pm.png" style="height: 254px;width: 300px;" /></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Step 3. <strong>Click</strong>&#160;the add-on offering for which you want to make changes. This opens the Manage Add-on page.</p>

<p>Step 4. <strong>Change</strong> options or fields as required to meet your new requirements.</p>

<div class="note_banner">Note: For a description of each of each field and option, see the <em>Add add-on offerings </em>section<em>.</em>&#160;</div>

<p>Step 5. When you are finished making changes, you can choose one of two options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Immediately click&#160;<strong>Save Add-on</strong>.</li>
	<li>First preview the changes by clicking&#160;<strong>Save and Preview</strong>. When you are satisfied with your changes, click&#160;<strong>Save Add-on</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clicking Save Add-on returns you to the Manage Add-on page.&#160;</p>

<h3 class="spy_this" id="cancel-an-add-on">Cancel an add-on</h3>

<p>To cancel an add-on, follow steps 1 to 3, and when you are on the Manage add-on page for the selected&#160;add-on, click <strong>Delete Add-on</strong> at the bottom of the page.</p>

<div class="note_banner">Note: When you click Delete Add-on, the add-on is removed immediately. There is no confirmation dialog box, so you should be sure you want to remove the add-on prior to clicking Delete Add-on.</div>
