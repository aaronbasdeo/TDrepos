On this page, the four revenue models are described, and procedures are included to configure the Payment Plans section for&#160;each of them. The revenue models are: free, one time, recurring and tiered.</span></p>

<div class="note_banner">Note: This page only describes procedures for the Payment Plans area on the <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" target="“_blank&quot;">Manage editions</a> and <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" target="“_blank&quot;">Add editions</a> pages. For all other elements related to adding or managing editions, refer to those pages.</div>

<h2 class="spy_this" id="configure-the-revenue-model"><a id="Configure the revenue model" name="Configure%20the%20revenue%20model"></a>Configure the revenue model</h2>

<p>For each of the four revenue models, use the following three steps to configure the pricing model and, if applicable, a free trial period (these steps&#160;apply to all revenue models).&#160;</p>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p><strong>Step 1.</strong> Go go <strong>Manage</strong> &gt; <strong>Billing and Distribution</strong>&#160;&gt; <strong>Products </strong>&gt;&#160;{Product name}&#160;|<strong>&#160;Edit&#160;</strong>&gt;<strong>&#160;Editions.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>What you do for this step&#160;depends on whether you are managing an existing edition or adding a new edition, as follows.&#160;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Manage an existing edition</strong>—In the list of editions, click the name of the edition&#160;you want to manage. The Manage Pricing Edition page opens. To complete the Payment Plans area, follow the procedures in step 4 (the next section) that correspond&#160;with your chosen revenue model. For all other fields and options to be completed, refer to the <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" target="_blank">Manage editions</a> section.</li>
	<li><strong>Create a new edition</strong>—Click <strong>Add New Edition</strong>. The Add Edition page opens. Follow the processes outlined in the <a href="http://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions">Add Editions</a>&#160;section. Then, to complete the Payment Plans area, follow the procedures for your corresponding revenue model (see <a href="#Configure%20price%20fields">Configure price fields</a>).&#160;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong> At the top of the Payment Plans area, enter the appropriate information for the following fields (these same three fields are visible for every revenue model).</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3422" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3422/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-08-20at-203-36-58-20pm.png" style="height: 250px;width: 600px;" /></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Free trial period</strong>—If you&#160;want to offer a free trial period to customers, choose whether the trial period is in days or months, then enter the duration.&#160;</li>
	<li><strong>Expired free trial grace period</strong>—The grace period represents the amount of time (in days) after the free trial ends&#160;before customers' service&#160;is cancelled.&#160;During that time they do not have access to their account and the application tile appears in a suspended state on the MyApps page.&#160;
	<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<li>If you leave this field&#160;blank&#160;the grace period defaults to the marketplace's default setting of 100 days.&#160;A value of zero means the product has no grace period, and the product is canceled the day after the free trial ends. This is not recommended because once a product is cancelled, users cannot recover the same account, even if they purchase the app.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Revenue model</strong>—Select the revenue model for this edition. All revenue models&#160;and the steps required to configure them&#160;are described in the following sections.&#160;</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="spy_this" id="configure-price-fields"><a id="Configure price fields" name="Configure%20price%20fields"></a>Configure price fields</h2>

<p>The remaining fields and options in the Payments and plans area vary depending on the revenue model you selected. Accordingly, follow the procedures that correspond to your selected revenue model (the following links provide rapid access to each section).</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="#Free">Free</a></li>
	<li><a href="#One%20time">One time</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Recurring">Recurring</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Tiered">Tiered</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="spy_this" id="free"><a id="Free" name="Free"></a>Free</h3>

<p>Free editions have no cost. They are configurable like any other edition but they have no pricing structure. They are the only edition type that can be configured to have an expiration date, at which point the user must switch to another edition or lose access to the application.</p>

<p>Free trial options include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free edition length</li>
	<li>Free trial grace period</li>
</ul>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p>To configure a free trial, you only need to configure the three fields described under <a href="#Configure%20the%20revenue%20model">Configure the revenue model</a>.&#160;</p>

<p>After you finish configuring the Payment Plans area, refer to the <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" target="_blank">Manage editions</a>&#160;or&#160;<a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions">Add editions</a> sections for descriptions and procedures to help you finalize the configuration of&#160;your edition.</p>

<h3 class="spy_this" id="one-time"><a id="One time" name="One%20time"></a>One time</h3>

<p>One-time editions have no duration or billing cycle. After customers purchase&#160;the edition, they own the product indefinitely. With this revenue model, users are always charged a flat rate for the product and because it is a one-time edition of the product, there is no recurring price option. Any future unit purchases are added to existing units. One-time editions cannot be downgraded since there is no cost for continuing to have more units.</p>

<p>One-time edition options include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free trial</li>
	<li>Expired free trial grace period</li>
	<li>Flat rate price</li>
	<li>Price per unit</li>
	<li>Usage restrictions</li>
</ul>

<p>After you configure&#160;steps 1-3, described in <a href="#Configure%20the%20revenue%20model">Configure the revenue model</a>,&#160;the one-time revenue model is selected, and the appopriate fields for this revenue model are displayed in&#160;the Payment Plans area.&#160;</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3426" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3426/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-08-20at-204-03-30-20pm.png" style="height: 272px;width: 600px;" /></p>

<p>With this revenue model, choose one of the following price configurations:</p>

<p><strong>Configure a single price that applies to all&#160;units</strong>—These can be users, megabytes or any other unit type.</p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Procedure</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Enter</strong> the price per unit in the Price field. If more than one currency is configured, enter the equivalent price for each currency, then complete&#160;the remaining&#160;fields of the Payment Plans section (these are not described on this page.&#160;See&#160;<a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" target="_blank">Manage editions </a>and <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" target="_blank">Add editions</a>&#160;for a descriptions and procedures).&#160;</p>

<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Configure&#160;advanced pricing options</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">—You can set&#160;tiered, metered or other pricing options for your one-time edition.</span></p>

<h4 style="margin-left: 40px;">Procedure</h4>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Step 1. </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Click </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Add Price per Unit</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">. The Price Per Unit area opens.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3439" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3439/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-08-20at-206-06-01-20pm.png" style="height: 279px;width: 499px;" /></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Step 2. </strong>Define the unit type. The default is set as&#160;Users,&#160;but you can change this to meet your needs. Many unit types are&#160;preconfigured, including megabytes, gigabytes, contracts, boxes, data points, and many others.&#160;To search for the unit type you need, start typing the unit type name in the&#160;per&#160;field, and options autopopulate.</p>

<div class="note_banner" style="margin-left: 40px;">Note: the unit type you select at this stage determines the type of unit that is&#160;used if you chose to create more advanced pricing options.</div>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Step 3. </strong>Click <strong>Add Usage Restrictions</strong>. This opens additional fields that allow you to set different prices based on the quantity purchased. For example, you can set different price levels per Megabyte depending on the number of Megabytes purchased.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3447" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3447/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-08-20at-206-25-15-20pm.png" style="width: 300px;height: 220px;" />&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>a. Configure the price per unit</strong>—In the box that appears below the currency type, enter the amount per unit. If your Marketplace Manager&#160;has configured several currencies, there is a box&#160;for each currency. Enter the amount in each box, based on applicable conversion rates.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>b. Define the minimum and maximum number of units for the first tier</strong>—For example, 1-100. This means that the user pays the price indicated for each of the first 100 megabytes.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>c. Add additional tiers (optional)</strong>—If you want to add a usage range, click <strong>Add another usage range</strong>. Additional fields open. In this example, an additional usage range has been added for 100-200 megabytes of usage, and the price has been reduced to reflect the higher volume. Please note that the minimum for the second usage range must be the same number as the maximum for the first usage range. This applies for any subsequent usage ranges that you add.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3457" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3457/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-09-20at-204-34-46-20pm.png" style="height: 475px;width: 599px;" /></p>

<p style="margin-left: 80px;"><strong>d.</strong> There are three additional optional fields at the bottom of the Price per Unit area. Check those that appy to your product edition,&#160;using the following descriptions to guide your selection:</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<li>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Restrict purchases to increments of</strong>—Restricts the user to buying the product in specific increments. When you select this option, the input field for customers is converted to a dropdown list. For example, the customer might see&#160;a dropdown list of 5,10,15, and 20 units.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Keep pricing per tier with volume</strong>—To explain which option to select, it's easiest to use an example using this scenario:&#160;Price ranges are configured&#160;as follows: For the first 1-10,000 API calls, the price is set at $0 per call, and every call above 10,000 is charged at 10 cents:</p>

	<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<li>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>If the&#160;checkbox is not checked</strong>—For the first 10,000 API calls, the user is charged $0. However, after the 10,000 call threshold is passed, the user is charged $.10 for every call reported during the billing period, including the first 10,000. So for&#160;10,001 calls, the user is charged $10,001 X $0.10, for a total charge of&#160;$1000.10.&#160;</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>If this functionality&#160;is activated with a checkmark</strong>—There is no charge for the first 10,000 API calls. For each API call above the 10,000 threshold, those additional calls are charged at $.10 per call. Therefore, for 10,001 calls, the user is charged $.10.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Display price per increment</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">—When the increment checkbox is clicked, set the minimum quantity to purchase to match the increment. This changes the display on the product Pricing &amp; Editions page to reflect the cost based on the minimum number of required units, instead of the price per individual unit. For example, if you set a minimum of&#160;5, and an increment of 5, at $1 per user, the customer sees a price of $5/5 users instead of the normal $1/user.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. After you complete&#160;steps 1-3, you can create another pricing configuration. To do so, click&#160;<strong>Include another usage rate&#160;</strong>and complete the fields using the same process just described.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5. </strong>After you finish configuring the Payment Plans area, complete the configuration of your product edition by scrolling down&#160;to the Included Items area (see the&#160;<a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" target="_blank">Manage editions</a> or <a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" target="_blank">Add editions</a>&#160;sections for descriptions and procedures).</p>

<h3 class="spy_this" id="recurring"><a id="Recurring" name="Recurring"></a>Recurring</h3>

<p>Recurring editions are the recommended model for selling web applications. The customer is charged a standard amount on&#160;a recurring basis. Options available for recurring editions include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free trial</li>
	<li>Expired free trial grace period</li>
	<li>Flat rate price</li>
	<li>Price per unit</li>
	<li>Usage restrictions</li>
	<li>Dependent setup fee</li>
	<li>One-time setup fee</li>
	<li>Contracts</li>
</ul>

<p>The setup for the recurring revenue model includes many of the same&#160;steps as found in the one-time edition previously described. The primary difference is that charges are recurring instead of one-time, and some additional options are available, such as the ability to include a contract and a one-time setup fee.&#160;</p>

<p>After you configure&#160;steps 1-3, described in <a href="#Configure%20the%20revenue%20model">Configure the revenue model</a>, &#160;the recurring revenue model is selected and the appropriate fields for this revenue model&#160;display in the Payment Plans area. Use the following steps to continue configuring this edition.&#160;</p>

<h4>Procedure&#160;</h4>

<p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Complete all required fields and select options under Recurring Price, as follows.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Billing frequency</strong>—From the dropdown list, choose one of the seven&#160;options available.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Flat Rate Price</strong>—A flat rate can be recurring or one time. The price you set here will be charged at the billing frequency you selected above. Add advanced pricing options for tiered, metered or other pricing settings.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Price Per Unit</strong>—Include per-unit prices to charge per given unit type. For example, for $5.00/megabyte at a monthly frequency, your customer will define how many megabytes they would like to buy at the time of purchase and then be billed monthly.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">d. Unit type</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">—Define the unit type. The default is set as&#160;Users,&#160;but you can change this to meet your needs. Many unit types are&#160;preconfigured, including megabytes, gigabytes, contracts, boxes, data points, and many others. To search for the unit type you need, start typing the unit type name in the&#160;per&#160;field, and options autopopulate.</span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">e. Price range</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">—Enter the price for the first range, then Click&#160;Add Usage Restrictions&#160;to open the price range fields. In the example in the image, two price ranges (tiers) have been configured.&#160;</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>f. Add another usage range</strong>—Click this link to configure another usage range. If you add another usage range, two additional fields open:</span></span></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Restrict purchases to increments of</strong>—This restricts the user to buying the product in specific increments. When you select this option, the input field for customers is converted to a dropdown list. For example, the customer might see&#160;a dropdown list of 5,10,15, and 20 units.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>Display price per increment</strong>—If you clicked the increment checkbox, set the minimum quantity to purchase to match the increment. This changes the display on the product Pricing &amp; Editions page to reflect the cost based on the minimum number of required units, instead of the price per individual unit. For example, if you set a minimum of&#160;5, and an increment of 5, at $1 per user, the customer sees a price of $5/5 users instead of the normal $1/user.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>g. Metered usage</strong>—When configured to active, this&#160;enables metered usage for the specified unit type. For example,&#160;$5/user based on usage.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>h. Setup fee per user</strong>—When active, this results in an additional cost per unit at the first checkout for each unit purchased. For example,&#160;$50 setup for each $20/unit/month.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><strong>i. Include another usage rate</strong>—If needed, configure another usage rate following the preceding steps, starting at Price Per Unit.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>j. One-time setup fee</strong>—Click <strong>Add a One Time Setup Fee</strong> to activate&#160;this optional feature. This fee is only due at the first checkout and is not billed again. Upgrades and downgrades do not incur this fee. Customers are charged a one-time setup fee&#160;if they cancel and repurchase the product, or if they switch editions.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">k. Contract terms</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">—Click </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">Add Contract Terms</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> to display the contract fields. Following is a description of all&#160;fields and options on the contract form.</span></p>

<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<li><strong>Minimum contract duration</strong>—The value you enter determines the number of billing cycles during which a customer is under contract. During this period the contract specifications outlined in the contract fields are in effect.</li>
	<li><strong>Contract fee</strong>—The contract fee is a one-time fee that is charged at the beginning of a contract, and when a contract is renewed.&#160;</li>
	<li><strong>Grace period</strong>—The value you enter&#160;gives users&#160;a period of time in which to select a new contract or edition&#160;before their product is canceled.</li>
	<li><strong>Termination fee</strong>—Your selection determines the type of termination fee that applies when customers cancel&#160;prior to the end of their contract. When you select a percentage-based or flat termination fee,&#160;additionals field opens, where you must enter the amount and a description. The description you enter here is visible on the customer's invoice.</li>
	<li><strong>Auto renew by default after the end of the contract period</strong>—The option you select is shown to the customer as the default option for what happens at the end of the contract period. The customer has the ability to override the default you choose.</li>
	<li><strong>Cancellation period limit</strong>—Customers have the number of days configured to cancel their contract, failing which the contract is renewed with the same conditions and duration.</li>
	<li><strong>End of contract grace period</strong>—&#160;When auto-renew is disabled on a contract, this setting gives users a period of time in days during which they can change which edition they are subscribed to without cancelling their subscription. This&#160;effectively restarts the contract. During the grace period, the subscription becomes inactive. If the user opts in to another edition during that time, the subscription becomes active and access is reinstated. If the user takes no action before the end of the grace period, the subscription is cancelled.</li>
	<li><strong>Block edition upgrades for subscriptions with active contracts</strong>—Selecting this option blocks a customer from increasing units or upgrading tiers while under contract. Changes made apply at the end of the contract.</li>
	<li><strong>Block edition downgrades for subscriptions with active contracts</strong>—This blocks customers from decreasing units or downgrading tiers while under contract. Changes made apply at the end of the contract.</li>
	<li><strong>Block switch to shorter contract</strong>—When this option is checked, the user cannot switch to a shorter-length contract, nor to one with no contract. &#160;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Configure optional usage options as required, available at the bottom of the Recurring Price area. These include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Allow custom&#160;metered usage</strong>—Selecting this option allows&#160;the developer to charge the user for custom metered usage</li>
	<li><strong>Separate pre-paid order</strong>—If metered usage is enabled, this option is available. This splits metered usage billing onto a separate order. Other charges occur at the beginning of the billing cycle, this charge occurs at the end.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep billing cycle on usage change</strong>—When this feature is activated, it keeps the order on the same billing cycle. Upon update, the users pays the prorated amount for the remaining time in the current billing cycle and then start the full amount at the start of the next billing cycle. For example, if a customer&#160;already purchased 5 users at $1/ month and upgrades half-way through the month to 15 users, they owe $5 at the time of upgrade (half&#160;of the 10 users) and&#160;pay&#160;$15 at the start of the next billing cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong>&#160;After you finish configuring the Payment Plans area, complete the configuration of your product edition by scrolling down&#160;to the Included Items area&#160;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">(see</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">&#160;</span><a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank">Manage editions</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> or </span><a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" style="line-height: 1.5;" target="_blank">Add editions</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> pages for the required procedures).</span></p>

<h3 class="spy_this" id="tiered"><a id="Tiered" name="Tiered"></a>Tiered</h3>

<p>Tiered editions are exactly like recurring editions except they allow you to specify separate pricing structures on separate billing cycles. The pricing structures are presented as part of a single edition and are selected via a dropdown list of billing cycles. This is most commonly used to specify monthly and yearly rates for the same edition. It can also be used to define&#160;different rates depending on the length of a contract.</p>

<p>Options available for recurring editions include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Free trial</li>
	<li>Expired free trial grace period</li>
	<li>First pricing structure</li>
	<li>Flat rate price</li>
	<li>Price per unit</li>
	<li>Usage restrictions</li>
	<li>Dependent setup fee</li>
	<li>One-time setup fee</li>
	<li>Contracts</li>
	<li>Second pricing structure</li>
</ul>

<p>After you configure&#160;steps 1-5&#160;as&#160;described in <a href="#Configure%20the%20revenue%20model">Configure the revenue model</a>,&#160;the tiered revenue model is selected, and additional fields open in the Payment Plans area. Following are descriptions of each field and the procedures to follow.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Rank</strong>—If you enter a checkmark, the price configured displays as the primary price for this edition.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Billing frequency—</strong>From the dropdown list, select&#160;one of the billing frequency options.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Flat rate price</strong>—Enter the flat rate price for this edition of the product. This is a static amount that is charged&#160;each billing cycle. If more than one currency is configured, enter corresponding prices for each currency.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong> The Price Per Unit area of the page is where you can configure tiers for the product. Follow the procedures described after the image for each field.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3469" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3469/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-10-20at-2011-44-20-20am.png" style="height: 325px;width: 400px;" /></p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a, Unit type</strong>—Define the unit type. The default is set as&#160;Users,&#160;but you can change this to meet your needs. Many unit types are&#160;preconfigured, including megabytes, gigabytes, contracts, boxes, data points, and many others. To search for the unit type you need, start typing the unit type name in the&#160;per&#160;field, and options autopopulate.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Price range</strong>—Enter the price for the first range, then Click <strong>Add Usage Restrictions</strong> to open the price range fields. In the example in the image, two price ranges (tiers) have been configured.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">c. Add another usage range</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">—Click this link to configure another usage range. If you add another usage range, two additional fields open.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Restrict purchases to increments of</strong>—This restricts the user to buying the product in specific increments. When you select this option, the input field for customers is converted to a dropdown list. For example, the customer might see&#160;a dropdown list of 5,10,15, and 20 units.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Display price per increment</strong>—If you clicked the increment checkbox, set the minimum quantity to purchase to match the increment. This changes the display on the product Pricing &amp; Editions page to reflect the cost based on the minimum number of required units, instead of the price per individual unit. For example, if you set a minimum of&#160;5, and an increment of 5, at $1 per user, the customer sees a price of $5/5 users instead of the normal $1/user.</li>
</ul>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>d. Metered usage</strong>—When configured to active, this&#160;enables metered usage for the specified unit type. For example,&#160;$5/user based on usage.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>e. Setup fee per user</strong>—When active, this results in an additional cost per unit at the first checkout for each unit purchased. For example,&#160;$50 setup for each $20/unit/month.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>f. One-time setup fee</strong>—Click <strong>Add a One Time Setup Fee</strong> to activate this optional feature. This fee is only due at the first checkout and is not billed again. Upgrades and downgrades do not incur this fee. Customers are charged a one-time setup fee if they cancel and repurchase the p roduct, or if they switch editions.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>g. Contract terms</strong>—Click&#160;<strong>Add Contract Terms</strong>&#160;to open the contract terms area. Following is a description of the fields and options on the contract form.</p>

<ul style="margin-left: 80px;">
	<li><strong>Minimum contract duration</strong>—The value you enter determines the number of billing cycles during which a customer is under contract. During this period the contract specifications outlined in the contract fields are in effect.</li>
	<li><strong>Contract fee</strong>—The contract fee is a one-time fee that is charged at the beginning of a contract, and when a contract is renewed.&#160;</li>
	<li><strong>Grace period</strong>—The value you enter&#160;gives users&#160;a period of time in which to select a new contract or edition&#160;before their product is canceled.</li>
	<li><strong>Termination fee</strong>—Your selection determines the type of termination fee that applies when a customers cancel&#160;prior to the end of their contract. When you select a percentage-based or flat termination fee,&#160;additionals field opens, where you must enter the amount and a description. The description you enter here is visible on the customer's invoice.</li>
	<li><strong>Auto renew by default after the end of the contract period</strong>—The option you select is shown to the customer as the default option for what happens at the end of the contract period. The customer has the ability to override the default you choose.</li>
	<li><strong>Cancellation period limit</strong>—Customers have the number of days configured to cancel their contract, failing which the contract is renewed with the same conditions and duration.</li>
	<li><strong>End of contract grace period</strong>—&#160;When auto-renew is disabled on a contract, this setting gives users a period of time in days during which they can change which edition they are subscribed to without cancelling their subscription. This&#160;effectively restarts the contract.&#160;
	<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
		<li>During the grace period, the subscription becomes inactive. If the user opts in to another edition during that time, the subscription becomes active and access is reinstated. If the user takes no action before the end of the grace period, the subscription is cancelled.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Block edition upgrades for subscriptions with active contracts</strong>—Selecting this option blocks a customer from increasing units or upgrading tiers while under contract. Changes made apply at the end of the contract.</li>
	<li><strong>Block edition downgrades for subscriptions with active contracts</strong>—This blocks customers from decreasing units or downgrading tiers while under contract. Changes made apply at the end of the contract.</li>
	<li><strong>Block switch to shorter contract</strong>—When this option is checked, users cannot switch to a shorter-length contract, nor to one with no contract. &#160;&#160;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 3. </strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">At the bottom of the Recurring Price area, you can activate&#160;the following additional features related to usage options.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Allow custom&#160;metered usage</strong>—Selecting this option allows&#160;the developer to charge the user for custom metered usage</li>
	<li><strong>Separate pre-paid order</strong>—If metered usage is enabled, this option is available. This splits metered usage billing onto a separate order. Other charges occur at the beginning of the billing cycle, this charge occurs at the end.</li>
	<li><strong>Keep billing cycle on usage change</strong>—A toggle that makes the order keep the same billing cycle when updated. upon update, the user pays the prorated amount for the remaining time in the current billing cycle and then start the full amount at the start of the next billing cycle. For example, if a customer&#160;already purchased 5 users at $1/ month and upgrades half-way through the month to 15 users, they owe $5 at the time of upgrade (half&#160;of the 10 users) and&#160;pay&#160;$15 at the start of the next billing cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4.&#160;</strong>After you finish configuring the Payment Plans area, complete the configuration of your product edition by scrolling down&#160;to the Included Items area (see&#160;<a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/manage-editions" target="_blank">Manage editions</a><em>&#160;</em>or&#160;<a href="https://ad.docs.appdirect.com/marketplace/documentation/developer-center/products/products/edit-editions-and-pricing/add-editions" target="_blank">Add editions</a><em>&#160;</em>pages&#160;<span style="line-height: 1.5;">for the required procedures).</span></p>
