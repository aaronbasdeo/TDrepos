<p>From the Create New Product page, name your product, and choose a service type, integration type, usage model, and revenue model for it.&#160;</p>

<p>Complete the following procedure to create a new product from the Developer Center.</p>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p><strong>Step 1.&#160;</strong>Go to <strong>Manage &gt;</strong>&#160;<strong>Billing and Distribution </strong>&gt;<strong>&#160;Products</strong>. The Manage Your Products page appears.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2.</strong>&#160;Click&#160;<strong>Add Products</strong>. The Create New Product&#160;page appears. All fields in the image are described after it.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3414" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3414/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-07-20at-201-12-36-20pm.png" style="height: 617px;width: 488px;" /></p>

<div class="tips_banner">Tip: The default&#160;product type&#160;&#160;is&#160;Web Application<em>,&#160;</em>and it is not configurable on the Create New Product page. However, if that product type does not meet your needs, contact your AppDirect technical representative.&#160;</div>

<p><strong>Step 3.</strong>&#160;Enter the product name. This is the name that&#160;marketplace customers&#160;and Company Administrators&#160;see when they shop for and&#160;purchase your product, and when they use and manage the product.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Select&#160;one of the following service type options:</p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Standalone Product</strong>—Does not need to be associated with another product before it can be listed, sold, and used on a marketplace.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Add-on for Product</strong>—Requires an association with a standalone product before&#160;it can be listed, sold, and used on a marketplace.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 5. </strong>Select one of the integration type options. This determines if the product is automatically provisioned, or not.</p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Referral Only</strong>—Products have a profile on the marketplace for marketing purposes only. Leads generated by the product's profile&#160;are redirected to the developer's website. Sales for referral products are&#160;not&#160;completed on the marketplace.</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Full Integration</strong>—Requires that you completely integrate the product with AppDirect. The marketplace handles purchases, service provisioning, and user management. The marketplace also tracks all data, so that you can track sales.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 6.</strong> Select one of the usage model options. The usage model&#160;determines the way in which users access the application. It is important to select the right usage model, since it cannot be changed after the product is created.</p>

<ul>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Single User</strong>—Allows only one user account to access, and use&#160;the product. Typically, user access to the product is managed by Company Administrators.&#160;</li>
	<li style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>Multiple Users</strong>—Allows multiple user accounts to access, and use&#160;the product. Typically, Company Administrators assign products to users.&#160;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 7. </strong>Select one of the&#160;Revenue Model options to determine how you charge for your product.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Free</strong>—Product requires no payment. It is free of charge.</li>
	<li><strong>One time</strong>—Product requires one payment in full.</li>
	<li><strong>Recurring</strong>—Product requires multiple payments on a developer-defined schedule, for example, monthly.</li>
	<li><strong>Tiered</strong>—Product includes&#160;various unit increments for sale at a price per unit. This pricing model allows developers to offer price breaks to customers as they purchase more units.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 8.</strong>&#160;Click <strong>Create Product</strong>. The product is now created, and appears on the Product Dashboard.</p>

<p>From the Product Dashboard, you can edit the product profile&#160;and branding, add and manage editions of the product, edit settings and discounts,&#160;as required. These functionalities are described starting in the next section.</p>

<div class="note_banner">Note: &#160;Some elements are configured by default when you click Create Product. For example, you cannot set the product's price for the product during the initial product creation, but a default price is set by the system. You&#160;can edit the product after it has been created &#160;to ensure it is fully configured to meet your needs. &#160;This guide provides more information about these topics, including:&#160;<em>Edit profiles and branding</em>,&#160;<em>Edit editions and pricing</em>, <em>Edit integration settings</em>, <em>Edit device settings</em>, and <em>Edit settings</em>.</div>
