<p>After a Developer creates a product, they can create product versions. This is required in the following situations:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You need to create an updated version of the downloable file (for example, for a bug fix, or to introduce a new feature).</li>
	<li>You want to expand the set of devices that your product supports. The new product version has different compatibility attributes (for example,&#160;a new operating system version).</li>
</ul>

<p>The following&#160;procedure outlines the steps to create a new product version.</p>

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>.&#160;Ensure that AppDirect has enabled and configured platforms for your marketplace.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>. Go to&#160;<strong>Manage</strong> &gt; <strong>Billing and Distribution</strong> &gt; <strong>Products</strong> &gt;&#160;{name of product} &gt; <strong>Edit </strong>&gt; Devices &gt;<strong> Platforms</strong>. The list of existing platforms&#160;displays in the left navigation in the Devices pane.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>. Click the name of the platform where the product for which you want to add a new version resides.</p>

<p>In this example, the platform is Microcomputers. Clicking the platform name opens the Product Versions page, with a list of existing product versions. Each product version lists the version name, version code, status and when it was last updated.</p>

<p>There are two ways to create a new product version :</p>

<ul>
	<li>Duplicate the version you are viewing. Use this option when the new product version has many of the same configurations as the existing one. This allows you to create a new product version more rapidly. Change only the&#160;details required to create the new product version, and upload&#160;the correct asset file for the new product version.</li>
	<li>Click Add Product Version. Proceed to step 4 for this option.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong>. Click <strong>Add Product Version</strong>. The product version creation page opens.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Note that the top section is incomplete, since the product version is in draft form.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>. Enter all required information in the Product Version Details pane, following these procedures:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>a. Title</strong>—Internal name used in the content management system&#160;for the Product Version. Allows the Marketplace Manager to quickly differentiate between product versions. This name is not visible to customers.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>b. Version Code</strong>—Used to determine whether one version is more recent than another. This must be a positive integer that is higher than the value entered for the previous product version. If left blank, the next incremental value is entered automatically when the product version is saved.&#160;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>c. Version Name</strong>—The product version name that is visible to users on their devices. Change the name that automatically appears in this field to something that is meaningful for customers. &#160;For example: Initial free version.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>d. File Asset</strong>—Click <strong>Choose File</strong> to upload the file that will be downloaded to the device. Each product version has its own asset file.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><strong>e. Product version-specific fields</strong>—Enter required information in each of the remaining fields in the Product Version Details pane. When creating the platform, the Marketplace Manager defined the information that must be configured to create a product version. These can include text fields, checkboxes or drop-down lists. &#160;For example: Model, operating&#160;system, RAM, required connectivity, and others.</p>

<p><strong>Step 5. </strong>Click <strong>Save</strong>. A notification appears, confirming that the product version&#160;has&#160;been saved. Additionally, fields that were previously gray and empty are now completed. You can make further edits if required at this stage, then click Save again.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>. Click <strong>Request Approval</strong>. This notifies the Marketplace Manager that the product version is ready for their approval. The Marketplace Manager approves and pubishes&#160;the product version. If the request is denied, you receive a notification with an explanatory message. In that case, make the required changes using the procedures previously described, and click Request Approval again.</p>

<p>After you click Request Approval, you are returned to the Product Versions Detail page, where you can take other actions to manage product versions.</p>
