<p>When you develop editions of a product, you can create features that are common to all editions. These appear on the product profile page, where all editions are listed. In the same manner, you can create footnotes that apply to all editions. &#160;</p>

<p>Following is an example of what your profile page might look like with shared features and footnotes.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="3410" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/3410/original/screen-20shot-202017-03-06-20at-206-26-16-20pm.png" style="height: 494px;width: 600px;" /></p>

<p>Notes regarding the preceding image:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The&#160;features that apply to all editions are visible in the All Plans Include area in the top left corner of the page.</li>
	<li>Any footnotes entered appear at the bottom of the page under Notes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Use the following procedures to create shared features and footnotes.</p>

<h4>Procedures</h4>

<p><strong>Step 1. </strong>Go to&#160;<strong>Developer &gt; Products &gt;&#160; </strong>{productName}<strong> | Edit &gt; </strong>Editions and Pricing<strong> | Shared Features &amp; Footnotes</strong>. The following page appears.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-rich-file-id="1485" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/doc-center/rich/rich_files/rich_files/1485/original/208-all-sharedfeaturesfootnotesuif.png" style="height: 421px;width: 599px;" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 2. </strong>Under Shared Features, <strong>enter a shared feature </strong>in the empty Feature field. Click <strong>Add Footnote</strong> to add another feature. You may add as many features as required using the same process.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3. </strong>Under Footnotes, <strong>enter a footnote</strong> to appear at the bottom of the product profile page. If needed, add additional footnotes.</p>

<p><strong>Step 4. </strong>Click <strong>Save and Preview</strong> to see how the shared features and footnotes appear on the product profile page. Alternately, you may forego the preview step by immediately clicking <strong>Save</strong> after entering all features and footnotes.</p>

<div class="note_banner">Please note: When in preview mode, to view editions and shared features and footnotes, click the last tab on the right&#160;of&#160;the product profile page.</div>
