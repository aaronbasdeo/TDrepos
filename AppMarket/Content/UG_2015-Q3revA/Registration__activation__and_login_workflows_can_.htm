        <p>Certain features can be enabled, disabled, or configured per marketplace instance, which affect the workflows to register a user account, activate it, and log in to it. For example, a marketplace might enforce the collection of a known telephone number, or secure user data through two-factor authentication, or repel bots by imposing a CAPTCHA — or it might not. We support many such variants and enhancements, and we add support for new variants all the time.</p>
