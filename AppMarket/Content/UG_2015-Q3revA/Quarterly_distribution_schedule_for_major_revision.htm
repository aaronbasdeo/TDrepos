        <p>We plan to distribute major revisions of this guide at (approximately) 90-day intervals. This revision cycle should help us to maintain rough parity with all of the new and changed features that our platform introduces over the weeks in a given quarter without introducing or perpetuating much slack. </p>
        <p>Any unplanned minor revisions to this guide, distributed outside of the standard 90-day cycle, are reserved for making corrections to typographical errors, factual errors, or significant omissions.</p>
        <p>Between major user guide distributions, <i>channel administrators</i> can check the weekly release notes on their respective Doc Centers to learn about any deltas between this guide and the product as we implement it in a given weekly release. </p>
