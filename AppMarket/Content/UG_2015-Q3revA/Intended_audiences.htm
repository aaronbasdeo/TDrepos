        <p>At AppDirect, our namesake platform is multi-sided, serving the overlapping interests of roughly two dozen distinct user roles. So, various parts of this user guide collect together the chapters that address each of its various audiences. This guide’s mandate is to mentor one AppDirect audience at a time toward deepened expertise. See <MadCap:xref href="User_role_basics.htm#introduction_243193183_1200723">User role basics</MadCap:xref>, to learn about AppDirect-standard, assignable user roles that your marketplace might&#160;support.</p>
