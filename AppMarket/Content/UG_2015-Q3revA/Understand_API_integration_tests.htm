        <p>Information exchange is essential when vendors sell products through your marketplace. Vendors cannot provision consumer access to a product, for example, without knowing how many seats to reserve and assign, according to what cost basis, across what contract duration, and for which registered users in particular. Meanwhile, your marketplace cannot complete ordinary operations without access to real-time vendor provisioning and uptime data. </p>
        <p>These few examples do not encompass every motivation for information sharing, of course, but they do illustrate the operational urgency. Neither your marketplace nor its vendors’ products can function as designed without a stable framework to keep mission-critical information flowing freely in both&#160;directions.</p>
        <p>What supplies the necessary communications framework to accomplish this data exchange? The public AppDirect developer APIs do. Each registered vendor runs dedicated API endpoint servers that listen for (and respond to) API event messages from your marketplace. </p>
        <p>API integration tests&#160;confirm that vendor API endpoints are reachable, configured correctly, and operating without&#160;error. </p>
