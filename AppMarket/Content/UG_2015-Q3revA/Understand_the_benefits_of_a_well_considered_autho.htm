        <p><span class="_Override">In an abstract sense, each assignable user role begins as a range of thresholds: Such-and-such user has at least enough authority to do X, but possibly enough authority to do Y in addition to X. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="_Override">Having made the decision that a certain user role should be enabled at all on your marketplace, your next task is to determine the scope of its authority. For example, is the role’s recipient authorized to see X, or see and rename it, or see and rename and delete it?</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="_Override">As you toggle aspects of authority On or Off for a certain user role, you determine how the role’s recipients fit into your marketplace and its community of authorized users.</span>
