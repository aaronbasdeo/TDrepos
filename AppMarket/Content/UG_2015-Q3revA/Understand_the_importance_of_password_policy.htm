We recommend this because strong passwords are objectively better than weak ones at doing what a password is meant to do. Strong passwords are more effective than weak ones at preventing fraud and theft. Strong passwords are more effective&#160;than weak ones at protecting intangible assets, including your organization’s reputation and brand equity. Also, strong passwords are less vulnerable than weak ones to social engineering, dictionary attacks, and&#160;brute force attacks. </span>
