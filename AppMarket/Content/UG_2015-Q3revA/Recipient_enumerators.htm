        <p>Tables on the Customer Emails page list all of the email notification message templates that are configured for availability on your marketplace, and each such table includes a “To” column. Values in this column cite generally who receives the corresponding message. </p>
        <p><span class="_Override">It would be easy to think all recipient types that the “To” column cites should be exact matches for assignable user roles on your marketplace. However, this is not how our notifications work. Rather than centering on user roles, most notification messages target people based on their relationships to certain resources, opportunities, milestones, obligations, and lapses that your marketplace tracks. </span>
