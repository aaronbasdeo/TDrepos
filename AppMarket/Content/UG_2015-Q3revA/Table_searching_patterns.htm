        <p>Depending on the combination of all your user role assignments on a given marketplace, you might have access to as many as 50 search forms in various parts of its user interface. However, most users are authorized to see and use fewer than five of these. Nevertheless, all of the search forms that you can access share certain traits in common.</p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1"><b>Search context</b>&#160;—&#160;The context for each search form gives you an immediate sense of what it can help you to find, as well as what it cannot. For example, your search for user accounts cannot succeed when initiated from an inventory of published products. Instead, you would search for users in a list of users<span class="_Override">. S</span>imilarly, you would not start your search for registered companies from a ledger of processed payments. When you want to find records of a particular kind, the only possibly effective way to search for them is from a pertinent search form, which accompanies a pertinent listing. <br /><br />Furthermore, when the context for a search form has already limited its scope to a single <span class="_Override"><MadCap:xref href="Glossary.htm#introduction_243193183_1742064">entity</MadCap:xref>— such as a listing of all products associated with one user in particular or of all payments associated with one registered company in particular<span class="_Override"> — u</span>nderstand that what the form actually can search is always constrained to exactly that same scope. You cannot find what is not there.</span></p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1"><b>Supported characters</b>&#160;—&#160;We do not forbid or reject any characters in search form queries. Instead, our security best practices prevent any inadvertent processing of special characters<span class="_Override">,</span> <span class="_Override">s</span>uch as <b>~!@#$%^&amp;*()_+=&lt;&gt;?</b><span class="_Override">,</span> as executable code. Even so, such characters are not likely to match any valid&#160;records. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.Comment">[<span class="C_Comment">What about support for other character encoding than UTF-8?</span>]</MadCap:conditionalText></p>

For example, the suggestions might include various Microsoft products if you were to search for products that match such text strings as </span><span class="C_Comment" style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Black';">mi</span><span class="C_Comment" style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Regular';"> or </span><span class="C_Comment" style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Black';">ft</span><span class="C_Comment" style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Regular';">. You can choose a suggestion by clicking it, or you can ignore all suggestions and enter the full length of your query manually. </span><span class="_Override" style="color: #2c2925;">[</span><span class="C_Comment">Is this even true? Or is my browser itself caching queries and representing them back to me as suggestions?</span><span class="_Override" style="color: #2c2925;">] [</span><span class="C_Comment">Assuming that this really is true, is the actual behavior covered in any spec?</span><span class="_Override" style="color: #2c2925;">]</span>
        </p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1"><b>Minimum and maximum query lengths</b>&#160;—&#160;We do not enforce any maximum or minimum query length. Nonetheless, extremely terse queries are likely to return at least some low-value matches, whereas overly verbose queries might omit some records that you would hope to find. <MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.Comment">[<span class="C_Comment">Exactly which indices do we derive these suggestions from? What is their intended scope?</span>]</MadCap:conditionalText><br /></p>
        <p>Click in a search field to activate it for text entry. Then, type your query string in the search field and press <b>Enter</b>. Or, enter your query string and click the form’s submission button. In most cases, this button is labeled “Search” or is an icon&#160;—&#160;overlaid upon the search field itself&#160;—&#160;that resembles a stylized magnifying glass<MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.gigantic_image_to_hide"> (<img src="3_24.png" style="width: 42.66624px;height: 42.66624px;margin-bottom: 0.1828804px;" />)</MadCap:conditionalText>. </p>
