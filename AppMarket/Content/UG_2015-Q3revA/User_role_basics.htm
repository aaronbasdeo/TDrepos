        </p>
        <p><span class="_Override">When this guide touches upon the superficial access that some marketplaces allow to unauthenticated users — including those who are unauthenticated precisely because they have not registered any user account — it calls these people “visitors.” This pseudo-role is implicit and conditional. It exists on some marketplaces but not others and is never explicitly assigned. </span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="_Override">All other user roles assignments are explicit and active, meaning that registered users receive them through an administrator’s deliberate intervention.</span>
        </p>
        <p class="BL_BlockLabel"><span class="_Override">User role variations</span>
        </p>
        <p><span class="_Override">User roles and their names are somewhat variable from one marketplace to another, because some roles are not relevant to some business plans and preferred terminology can differ regionally or by industry. Furthermore, some roles must be enabled per marketplace before they are assignable to any user, or must be enabled per company before they are assignable to a given company's associated users.</span>
