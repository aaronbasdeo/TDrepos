        <p>Chapters, depending upon their purpose and scope, contain one, two, or three top-level headings from the industry-standard set of top-level headings: <b>Concepts</b>, <b>Procedures</b>, and <b>Reference</b>.</p>
        <p class="Bu1N_Bullet1_w_Next"><b>Conceptual</b> topics aim to drive meaningful insight by presenting abstract, theoretical, and situational information to be understood generally — such as the meaning or benefit — before undertaking associated work. They cover the background material, the context, the specialized vocabulary, essential strategies and tactics, restrictions (and other limitations), workflows, and so on, to help you make sense of your current setting and act wisely in it — by transferring to you an expert’s implicit knowledge. <i style="font-family: 'Aaux Next SemiBold';">What is possible in this arena? What is realistic? What is ideal? What are the relationships and dependencies?</i><i style="font-family: 'Myriad Pro';font-style: italic;"> <![CDATA[ ]]></i>There is no upper limit to the length of conceptual material. An idea or a framework is as complex as it is, and delving appropriately into its scope, effect, implications, or permutations takes as long as it takes.</p>
        <p class="Bu1N_Bullet1_w_Next"><b>Procedural</b> topics present specific, terse, practical knowledge to be applied in context, step-by-step. Their aim is to drive clear action toward a single, equally clear goal by capturing a journeyman’s explicit knowledge. These topics state how to accomplish narrow tasks that might, at different times, stand alone or be part of a larger workflow. Procedures are user-centered, goal-focused walkthroughs designed to reduce or eliminate the risk of surprise or failure. <i style="font-family: 'Aaux Next SemiBold';">How can I do this right the first time, right now? How can I optimize it?</i></p>
        <p class="Bu1_Bullet1"><b>Reference</b> topics isolate concrete facts outside their conceptual and procedural framework, aiming to drive fine-grained mastery. Often quantified and frequently tabular in form, they describe exactly what each UI element does and why. They answer FAQs. They explain error messages and teach troubleshooting techniques. In the best-case scenario, an audience that synthesizes this material develops the knowledge to overcome contingencies creatively. <i style="font-family: 'Aaux Next SemiBold';">Exactly what is required? What went wrong? How can I prevent, work around, or recover from a problem?</i><i style="font-family: 'Aaux Next Regular';">  <![CDATA[ ]]></i></p>
