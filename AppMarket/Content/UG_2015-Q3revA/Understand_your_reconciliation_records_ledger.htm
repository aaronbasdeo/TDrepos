        <p>Your reconciliations ledger shows an almost-live representation of open and closed revenue sharing payments made and due among all financial stakeholders as your marketplace tracks these reciprocal obligations. (The ledger does not refresh automatically in your browser, so its representation of reconciliations is only as recent as when your browser loaded it.)</p>
        <p>The ledger renders eight columns in its UI version and eight columns in its exportable CSV version. Although it is not searchable against any field, it supports filtering by creation date<span class="_Override"><MadCap:conditionalText MadCap:conditions="UG_2015-Q3revA.Comment"> [</MadCap:conditionalText></span><span class="C_Comment">creation of what?</span><span class="_Override">]</span><span class="_Override">.</span></p>
